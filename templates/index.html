        Hi there! My name is almond, and I like messing around with computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm an undergrad at
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.grinnell.edu/">Grinnell College</a>
        majoring in Computer Science, but also dabbling in pure math,
        linguistics, theater, and anything else that catches my attention. In
        order of my favorites, I'm comfortable programming in C, Python,
        Haskell, and Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also that nerd who uses linux on its personal laptop (surely
        widespread adoption can't be <b>that</b> far off, right?), and tries to
        use `awk`, `grep`, and a whole host of other CLI tools whenever they can
        get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to computing, I'm really fascinated by system
        administration--it lends itself wonderfully to my enjoyment of the
        command line, and I find a lot of fun in troubleshooting issues that
        arise on the systems that I manage. Sure, sometimes it can be really
        annoying to update all your configuration and services to a new domain
        name, but it's worth it in the end and a fun challenge along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also love working in peer education for CS, and just helping folks
        understand code in general. I've been able to participate in it a lot
        more thanks to being a TA at Grinnell, but even outside of school I find
        a lot of value in working with people on their projects--I learn a lot
        about what they're doing, and hopefully they learn more about how to
        code it! It's a win-win.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite computer related activities include tinkering with
        various projects, manager, playing Celeste, and breaking my window
        manager every other week. My favorite NON-computer related
        activities, on the other hand, include hiking, reading (mostly
        mystery and scifi), and coming up with new words to confuse my family
        and friends with.
